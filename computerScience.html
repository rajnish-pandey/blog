      <p>A career in computer science is a career you can fall in love with. There are so many reasons to fall in love with computer science careers. Here are our top 5 favorite reasons computer science careers are the best!</p>
      <h3>1. Endless Job Opportunities</h3>
      <p>As technology advances, so does the need for computer scientists. There are so many options for computer science careers. Here’s just a taste of some jobs that are available to those knowledgeable in computer science.</p>
      <h3>Software Engineer</h3>
      <p>A software engineer is the one that creates and manages computer programs including customer relations software, computer games, operations systems, and even video editing software. Software engineers work with the clients to plan and design the software for the target audience.</p>
      <h3>Computer Programmer</h3>
      <p>Computer programmers are the ones that write the code for the program that the software engineer wants to create. A computer programmer uses their creativity and problem-solving skills to figure out the best code for the software or application to give the user the best experience. Troubleshooting and fixing bugs are also part of the job description.</p>
      <h3>Mobile App Developer</h3>
      <p>Mobile app developers and computer programmers are similar, but also quite different. They both use code to write their programs, they both have to be creative and good problem solvers. A mobile app developer needs to also be proficient in the mobile app platforms, Android and iOS. Mobile app developers could also be part of the planning meetings to ensure that they understand what the target audience is looking for.</p>
      <h3>Web Developer</h3>
      <p>Web developers build websites. A graphic designer gives the design to the web developer, who then turns that into code that computers and various devices can read. Images and videos also get turned into code by a web developer for various devices to understand. Before building the website it is important for the web developer to understand the needs of the client and the target audience as well. Along with the interface and user experience specialist, they work together to ensure that the flow of the website makes sense for the needs of the client.</p>

      <p>Database administrators collect the data that the website and mobile apps collect and make sense of it all and then tell the client about the data. This data that is collected can contain sensitive information, so it is also the job of a database administrator to keep the information safe. Database administrators keep information secure through backups and regularly scheduled maintenance checks.</p>
      <h3>2. The pay is high</h3>
      <p>According to PayScale, the average annual pay range for those holding a bachelor’s degree in computer science is $58,000-$119,000. As you can see from above, average yearly salaries range depending on the computer science career you choose to go with, but still are usually on the higher side. The average entry level salary for a computer scientists is $69,789.

Computer scientists get to put their passions into their work and really find a way to help society with new technology.</p>
      <h3>4. Computer science is cross-cultural</h3>
      <p>A career in computer science can be applied all over the world.
